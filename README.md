# Inverse Theory Coursework - Solving Inverse Problems Using Python

This repository contains the coursework and code for my Inverse Theory module at the University of Leeds. The module explores techniques for solving **inverse problems**â€”problems where we use measured data to estimate the parameters of a physical system, as opposed to solving **forward problems** where we predict measurements from known parameters.

## **Course Overview**

In this module, we covered a range of methods for solving inverse problems, including **least squares estimation**, **non-linear least squares**, **regularization**, and **Bayesian inversion**, among others. The coursework emphasises both the theoretical foundations of these techniques and their practical application using Python.

1. **Introduction to Inverse Theory**
   - Understanding forward vs inverse problems.

2. **Parametrisation and Least Squares Estimation**
   - Use of least squares to solve linear inverse problems.

3. **Uncertainty Quantification and BLUE**
   - Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) for parameter estimation.

4. **Non-linear Least Squares**
   - Solving non-linear inverse problems.

5. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Non-Uniqueness**
   - Dealing with non-unique solutions in inverse problems using SVD.

6. **Resolution Matrix & Regularization**
   - Understanding the resolution matrix and methods for regularizing ill-posed problems.

7. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**
   - Estimation of parameters using maximum likelihood.

8. **Direct Search Methods**
   - Optimisation techniques for inverse problems.

9. **Bayesian Inversion**
   - Implementing Bayesian methods for parameter estimation.

10. **Machine Learning for Inverse Problems**
   - Applications of machine learning techniques to inverse problems.
